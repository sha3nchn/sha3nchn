### Learning Github

 A [commit](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/about-commits) is a set of changes to the files and folders in your project. A commit exists in a branch.

 A [merge](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#merge) adds the changes in your pull request and branch into the `main` branch.

- Github, repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests.
- created a branch, a commit, and a pull request.
- merged a pull request.
- You made your first contribution!
